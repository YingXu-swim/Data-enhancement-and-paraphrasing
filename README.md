## Introduction
Compared with the traditional Bayesian personalised ranking recommendation algorithm, the hybrid Bayesian personalised ranking recommendation algorithm in this paper is complemented by adding a pairwise ranking triad constructed from the scoring ranking based on the independence weight coefficient algorithm, which constitutes a hybrid pairwise ranking triad. Finally, simulated recommendation experiments are trained on Python, and the final accuracy obtained by model evaluation is about 50% and coverage is about 90%.
